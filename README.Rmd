knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# ```hyspdisp```

```hyspdisp``` is an R package that runs HYSPLIT (https://ready.arl.noaa.gov/HYSPLIT.php) many times. The results can then be aggregated to zip code level.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
